# Abstract

The volume and quality of fake images and videos, in particular on human faces, generated by neural
network based forgery techniques has grown rapidly, resulting in the rampant spread of fakes new
and disinformation. In this paper, we will attempt to reproduce some state-of-the-art models, assess
the performance of these models and identify their challenges and limitations.
